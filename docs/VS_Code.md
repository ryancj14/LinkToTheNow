My changed settings: (Use `Command`+`,` to get there)
* Set `Terminal Scrollback` to `100000`, to allow for more lines to be kept in the terminal buffer.
* Check `Git: Always Sign Off`, to make every commit automatically signed off.

***

*If needed:*

If you choose to write your own programs, you will want to put . at the start of your classpath by adding the following to the bottom of your .bashrc file:
export CLASSPATH=.:$CLASSPATH
(or modify the original statement in the .bashrc to include . as well).
You can then write them anywhere and compile them, and if they are in the current directory they will run.

***

When you open up a file in VS Code that you don't want to be closed automatically, right click on the tab and click `Keep Open`. That was really helpful to learn because files just kept getting closed and replaced in the tab by new files I would open, which in that case I didn't want.

***

You can open a workspace, which basically means opening multiple folders instead of just one.

***

`ctrl + p` lets you search for a file in your directory.

***

F1 brings up a searchable drop-down of every command you can do in vs code.

***

`ctrl + space` brings up options

`ctrl + shift + space` brings back up the function arguments

***

You can have two terminals going by pressing the slpit page button on the terminal.

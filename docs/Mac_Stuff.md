# Mac Stuff

### Finder

SHIFT+COMMAND+H â€“ opens the Home directory in finder

When in the Home directory, click File > Add to Sidebar, to make it available from the sidebar

***

### Updating

My mac seems to have a problem updating. If it doesn't work, make sure you have enought space for it first and then if it still doesn't work (restarts but doesn't install), you can try this:

...  (Actually haven't found a solution yet)

***

### Moving Windows Between Desktops

When you swipe up to see all your open windows, you can drag a window to the top to move it into another desktop.

Then use (three or) four fingers to swipe between desktops.

***

### Swiping Shortcuts

There are actually lots of swiping shortcuts that I like and that I've become used to, so these are my checked options in Settings:

### Seeing hidden folders in Finder

Within Finder, use `command`+`shift`+`.` to be able to view hidden folders and files.

Usually you only need to interact with hidden files from the terminal (using `ls -a` to see all files) but if you do need them from Finder, that is how. Then you can use that same shortcut to hide them again.

***

## Screenshots

The normal ways to take screenshots are `shift`+`command`+`4` or `shift`+`command`+`5`. However if you need another way, then here you go:
```
screencapture -T 10 screenshot.jpg
```
Takes a screenshot of your screen 10 seconds after typing, saving it under the name `screenshot.jpg`. You can change this name or the length of time it waits by changing those arguments in the command. 

***

## Create a folder
Choose File > New Folder, or press `Shift`+`Command`+`N`.

***

## Clearing Caches
While using Photoshop, it told me there isn't enough scratch space on my computer. Clearing the caches appears to be the solution:

1. Open Finder
2. You may need to do `command`+`shift`+`.` from the home directory before following the rest of these steps.
2. Click `Go` from the menu at the top.
3. Hold down the `option/alt` key to reveal the hidden Library option.

4. Click on Library
5. ... On second thought, it didn't work. But there are lots of cache files in there that could possibly be cleared if needed.
